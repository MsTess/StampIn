However, it is important to note that most countries want to see proof that you plan to leave at some point. Therefore, ‘No Visa Required’ for most countries, means you should have the following:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            • A passport that is valid for 6 months past the date that you enter the country
                            <br>
                            • This passport must have at least one blank page
                            <br>
                            • Proof of sufficient funds
                            <br>
                            • Proof of onward or return flights
                            <br>
